** Notes on installing fftw-3.3.3 for Ivy Bridge on Ubuntu **

0) The default install produces worse code than the prebuilt package libfftw3

./configure && make && make install


1) By default only -mtune=native is enabled. A slight gain by compiling with the native instruction set specified.
   There are probably better configurations, but at least this is faster than the default.
   Fused multiply-add is not actually supported on Ivy Bridge, but the flag could be included anyway because it 
   gives better performance for the 16-element avx kernel. FMA in FFTW is supported by favoring "FMA" macros, 
   hoping that the compiler will replace it with the correct instructions. FMA is coming in Haswell.

make clean && make distclean

./configure CC="gcc -march=native" --enable-shared --enable-sse2 --enable-avx
make
make install


2) To install with different directory (for modified kernels)

./configure CC="gcc -march=native" --prefix=/usr/local/custom --enable-shared --enable-sse2 --enable-avx
make
make install
