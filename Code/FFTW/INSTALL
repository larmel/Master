** Notes on installing fftw-3.3.3 for Ivy Bridge on Ubuntu **

0) The default install is

./configure && make && make install


1) This produces worse code than the prebuilt package libfftw3; need to manually specify mmx and avx flags.
   By default only -mtune=native is enabled. A slight gain by compiling with the native instruction set specified.
   There are probably better configurations, but at least this is faster than the default.

make clean && make distclean

./configure CC="gcc -march=native" --enable-shared --enable-sse2 --enable-avx --enable-fma
make
make install


2) To install with different directory (for modified kernels)

./configure CC="gcc -march=native" --prefix=/usr/local/custom --enable-shared --enable-sse2 --enable-avx --enable-fma
make
make install
