Small test cases for finding out the properties of the LSD on a given machine
Note that this is nowhere near robust -- just meant to record what was done
on my particular machine. 

* Number of chunk fetches (32B)
  TODO: Might consider 16B? Docs say 32B, so not likely.

* Micro-ops
  Buffer can only hold a finite amount of instructions per loop.
  Implicitly decides size of micro-op queue.

* Taken branches
  Limit to number of taken branches.

These properties are assumed to be correct, and not tested.

- Mismatched stack operations

- All micro-ops resident in Decoded ICache

- At least 64 iterations
