\begin_layout Abstract
Performance analysis of software is subject to measurement bias.
 Seemingly innocious properties of the environment, such as the location
 of variables in memory, or even room temperature, can impact the performance
 of computer programs.
 Features and restrictions of the underlying hardware introduces performance
 cliffs; on one machine a piece of code might fit within a single cache
 line, while on another the alignment in memory fragments it in two.
 Effects like these have been shown to be significant, but unpredictable
 and difficult to deal with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In this thesis we will study bias effects that can be experienced by changing
 the Unix environment variables, or altering the program link order.
 In effect, both of these leads to different virtual memory layouts, which
 is what actually triggers the performance cliffs.
 Through experimentation and careful measurement using hardware performance
 counters, we identify several potential sources of bias.
 Limitations imposed by the Loop Stream Detector hardware optimization is
 modeled, along with effects from 4K address aliasing.
 We show that environment bias is in fact not completely unpredictable,
 and discuss measures can be made to try to avoid it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Finally, we show that even highly optimized FFT and linear algebra libraries
 are prone to bias.

Problem Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Variations in execution context has been shown to affect performance of
 programs on recent CPUs.
 Previous work has looked at offsetting the stack and changing link order
 -- biasing performance measurements towards certain configurations.
 Variables such as the placement of stack, heap and text segments in memory,
 combined with memory access instructions, can impact program performance
 quite significantly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this project is to model some of these effects for common use
 cases, and methods for avoiding them, in order to avoiding bias and achieving
 peak performance.
 These effects might be highly platform dependent, so to limit the scope
 we will focus on a particular architecture, the Intel Core i7 'Ivy Bridge'.
 Case studies will include small isolated programs, and ideally also

, the authors show how simple changes to the execution environment can heavily
 impact program performance.
 Two variables are studied; size of the Unix environment variables, and
 link order of object files.
 Both are found to be significant with respect to measured performance of
 standardized benchmarks.
 This paper is getting old however, thus it is unclear whether measurement
 bias is an issue on newer CPUs.
 A quick reproduction of one of their tests however, clearly shows that
 measurement bias is still an issue on the -- at the time of writing --
 most recent Intel Core i7 Ivy Bridge architecture.

 The code should not appear particularly extraordinary, yet its performance

 Even though the exact same binary executable file is run multiple times,

Outline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this thesis is to explore ways to tackle the effects of measureme
nt bias.
 Previous work has focused mostly on ways to statistically eliminate the
 effects in order to produce reliable measurements -- working towards a
 more statistically valid methodology employed in the computer science community.
 Our approach is slightly different.
 If bias could be controlled in certain situations, we could change program
 or environment to enhance performance -- essentially control the bias to
 work in our favor.

\begin_layout Section
Observer Effect and Measurement Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several papers dealing with bias in performance analysis have been published.
 Mytkowitcz et.
 al.
 provide an excellent introduction to measurement bias, together with the
 closely related phenomenon of observer effect, in the paper

\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 The authors draw parallels to the social and natural sciences, scientific
 fields where considerable care is taken to avoid observer effect and bias
 in experimental setups.
 They argue that the methodology currently employed in performance analysis
 for software is lacking, if not flawed.
 In a literature survey, they find that very few authors even considers
 potential effects of bias when evaluating results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Observer effect 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set of relevant metrics in performance analysis is diverse; a database
 application might be interested in the number of transactions per second,
 while the cycle count and cache misses might be more relevant for a sorting
 algorithm implementation.
 Many low level metrics such as cycle count and cache misses, can be aquired
 with minimal overhead by performance counters in hardware.
 In other cases we might need to add instrumentation to the program being
 measured, for example in the form of counter variables incremented for
 each function call.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mytkowitcz et al.
 shows that both strict use of hardware counters, as well as adding any
 form of software instrumentation, is vulnerable to observer effects.
 Even in standardized benchmark suites such as SPEC 2006, they find that
 change in performance due to observer effect is significant, enough to
 invalidate research results if not properly considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Measurement bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The performance characteristics of software changes also from external propertie
s of the experimental setup.
 The authors consider two, seemingly innocious, properties of the environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Link order of object files: The order of which the .o files are provided
 to the linker, usually more than one valid permutations exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Shell state, specifically environment variables.
 The content of environment variables depends on many factors, such as the
 user currently logged in (stored as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 in Linux), or which programs are currently installed, adding directories
 to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PATH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors study how different compiler optimization levels is affected
 by adding characters to environment variables or altering the permuting
 link order.
 The results show that SPEC benchmarks are sensitive to this as well.
 Different conclusions about O2's efficiency versus O3 can be drawn depending
 on the environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Causes of Measurement Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a following paper by the same authors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mytkowicz:2009:WrongData"

\end_inset

, the effects previously presented are reiterated, along with a more detailed
 analysis of measurement bias.
 In addition to pointing out sensitivity in large benchmark programs from
 the SPEC suite, the authors also provide a small, isolated C program with
 very high sensitivity to change in environment size.
 We discuss this particular program in the Introduction chapter, showing
 that similar bias effects appear on newer architectures as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For both changing environment variables and link order, the authors point
 to changes to the virtual memory layout being the real cause of bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Changing environment variables has an effect on where the stack is placed
 in memory at runtime.
 A copy of the environment is loaded into virtual address space before the
 call stack starts, thus increasing the environment size offsets the stack
 start address.
 The authors suggests that altering the stack addresses of variables at
 runtime can have an impact on things like alignment in cache and accuracy
 of branch predictors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Changing link order can change the virtual addresses of instructions.
 Using hardware simulators, the authors show that performance also depends
 on code alignment in memory.
 For instance, when a hot loop fits entirely in a single cache line, the
 number of accesses to instruction cache can be reduced.
 The authors speculate that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Loop Stream Detector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might cause bias on the Core 2, a hardware optimization that is supposed
 to speed up instruction fetching of hot loops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dispite demystifying the causes of bias to some degree, this paper provides
 no satisfactory explanation of exactly how or what hardware mechanisms
 causes bias.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dealing with Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conclusion reached in both papers is that measurement bias is unpredictable
 and difficult to avoid.
 Instead, measures have to made to ensure the results obtained by performance
 analysis are valid.
 The authors provide some guidelines for how to conduct sound experiments;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Diversify benchmarks, using statistical methods over a set of diverse benchmarks
 will help cancel out bias.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Randomize experimental setup, performing multiple measurements under different
 configurations of variables that are known to cause bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In literature survays, the authors find that almost no papers account for
 measurement bias, which can draw doubts to the validity of results.
 This should be a wake up call for the computer science community, hopefully
 employing more sound methodologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Exploiting Bias for Optimization

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have pointed out the problems bias causes for performance analysis.
 A different perspective on bias effects is to look at it as a potential
 for optimization.

 As CPUs become more and more sophisticated, creating a good model for optimizat

 Using automatically generated

 New program variants are generated by inserting alignment directives in
 the assembly, changing the memory address of each function or variable
 independently.
 A subset of program variants are generated, and evaluated by measuring
 execution time.

Using blind optimization, the authors are able to achieve up to 12.6 % speedup

Many more of these rules are encoded in MAO, resulting in reduced code size
 and use of more efficient instructions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to optimizing for the ISA, the code is also tuned for specific
 properties of Intel microarchitectures.
 As an example, MAO considers instruction address alignment for hot loops,
 inserting additional alignment directives if neccessary.
 By aligning frequently executed code segments to 16 byte boundaries, the
 instructions are more likely to fit in decode 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chunks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which are 16 B on the Intel Core 2.
 In previous work on measurement bias by Mytkowitcz et al, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

loop stream detector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is suggested as a potential cause of bias.
 The LSD is similarly dependent on code alignment in 16 B boundaries on
 the Core 2 architecture.
 MAO uses this knowledge to align code to fit in as few decode lines as
 possible, allowing the LSD to kick in and avoid instruction fetch for some
 hot loops.
 Another interesting architecture specific optimization considers available
 execution ports in the Core 2 when scheduling instructions.

Instruction-level parallelism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the key features of modern processors is instruction level parallelism.
 A great amount of logic is dedicated to be able to issue multiple instructions
 per cycle, increasing the throughput.
 The Ivy Bridge has six execution ports, giving a theoretical maximum of
 six micro-operations executed per cycle.

Memory Disambiguation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further increase parallelism, loads and stores are scheduled speculatively
 and out of order 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 During normal execution, the data dependencies between memory operations
 must be preserved.
 This poses some restrictions to the out of order issuing of instructions.
 A load that depends on a previous store must naturally wait until the store
 is complete.
 In cases where the addresses are unknown, the hardware must use conservative
 heuristics and can not reorder instructions easily.
 With memory disambiguation, the hardware makes a prediction on wether a
 conflict will occur.
 Loads can then be issued before stores that migth conflict, with the effect
 of increasing parallelism and hiding latency.
 The predictions are later verified before retirement, re-executing operations
 that actually had conflicts.

 In addition to unit mask and event code, the remaining bits can be set

\begin_layout Section
The Execution Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operating system might be cosidered a vital part of the execution environmen
t.
 Running tests on a particular operating system might very well result in
 big performance differences.
 Because of time limitations we have not considered bias effects due to
 specific variations in OS-es, but rather specific variations within the
 execution context provided by the operating system.
 For all our results, we have used the latest stable release of Ubuntu,
 version 12.04, updated with the latest kernel updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand why some of the bias effects occur, it is necessary to understand
 some of the low-level aspects of how processes and memory is managed by
 the operating system.
 In particular, we will see that changes to memory layout in virtual address
 space can lead to performance variations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Virtual Memory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before a program can be run, it needs to be loaded into memory in some way.
 The ELF file includes the path to an interpreter, a program that is responsible
 for loading code and data, setting up a stack, and loading any dependencies.
 Files compiled for execution on a 64 bit Linux platform will point to a
 loader in 
\family typewriter
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
\family default
.
 This file can be a symbolic link to the actual program.
 The loader then places each 
\emph on
allocable
\emph default
 section of the object file in virtual address space.
 The most important sections include the stack, heap, bss, data and text,
 as shown in Figure

A running process is divided into several sections within the virtual address
 space:

 and expanding downwards.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
heap Dynamically allocated memory, allocated above the text and data segments
 and growing upwards as programs request more memory.
 The start of heap is marked by 'brk'.
 A Linux system call to brk will request more memory, extending the current
 limit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
bss Uninitialized data.
 This segment occupies no space in the object file, only the size is needed.
 Everything is initialized to zero.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
data Initialized data, variables that have some assigned value at compile
 time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
text Executable binary code.
 This segment is placed at the lower end of virtual address space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dynamically loaded libraries are mapped into virtual memory as well.
 They typically end up with high addresses, located relatively close to
 the stack.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of loading segments to virtual memory is not necessarily determinist
ic.
 If virtual addresses can be known a priori, programs will be more vulnerable
 to buffer overflow attacks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Shackham:2004:ASLR"

\end_inset

.
 If an attacker manages to inject malicous code, he can use the known virtual
 addresses to access data or call any function.
 One technique known as 'return to libc' attacks uses this knowledge to
 call functions in the C standard library, which will be loaded in most
 scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Address space randomization is a technique employed by the operating system
 to make it more difficult to compromise programs.
 By default, the placement of stack, heap (initial position of brk) and
 location of dynamically linked libraries will vary between each run of
 a program.
 For a controlled execution environment we will need to manually disable
 address randomization in many cases.
 This is done by overwriting the randomize_va_space file.

\begin_layout Standard
The default value is 2, indicating full randomization.
 For randomizing only (??), a value of 1 can be written instead.
 We will use zero to disable all randomization, making virtual memory layout
 completely deterministic between each run.

Environment Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in previous work on measurement bias 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, the size of a user's Unix environment variable can affect the placement
 of stack.
 Environment variables are allocated above the stack, pushing the first
 possible stack starting address downwards.
 With ASLR disabled, the initial stack address can be manipulated by manually
 changing environment variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Memory Context of C Programs

, which are stack allocated.
 Their run-time address depends on where the stack segment is initialized
 in virtual memory, and can in general not be known ahead of time.
 The address returned by malloc and stored in variable d points to a location
 on the heap.
 The exact address depends on the implementation of malloc, as well as the
 initial position of the heap segment, and is also impossible to predict
 in general.
 Global variables a and b should be placed in bss and data segments respectively.
 Their virtual addresses are determined at compile time, and can be found

Sources of Measurement Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern microprocessors are extremely complex in design and functionality.
 Some of the features on our Ivy Bridge includes; several layers of cache
 to camouflage slow memory, multiple prefetchers -- able to detect strided
 access patters[ref], 
\emph on
macro fusion[ref]
\emph default
 -- combining simple instructions to one, speculative out-of-order execution,
 complicated branch prediction, just to name a few.
 Optimizing for the common case, these hardware features sometimes behaves
 badly.
 Dispite reasonably good documentation, only Intel knows all the details
 of the inner workings of the processor, leaving us with sort of a black
 box testing.
 In this chapter we will unveil characteristics about two architectural
 features in the Core i7; speculative out-of-order memory operations, and
 the Loop Stream Detector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Methodology and Experimental Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before going ahead with all the details, it is important to describe the
 methodology used to aquire accurate measurements.
 We make the following configuration to our experimental setup:

\begin_layout Itemize
Unless specified otherwise, address space layout randomization (ASLR) is
 kept disabled.
 This is necessary when testing effects from memory context, and often required
 to make results reproducible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hyper threading is disabled, ensuring that only one thread runs simultaneously
 on each core.
 Two threads competing on hardware resources is another potential source
 of bias, which we will not be studying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
System load is kept at a minimum to avoid interference with other processes
 and tasks.

\begin_layout Subsection
Bias from Stack Alignment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we saw in the Introduction chapter, changing the Unix environment variables
 can significantly affects the cycle count of this program.
 It is typically not the content of environment variables that are important,
 but rather the effect their size has on stack position.
 When programs are mapped into virtual memory, the environment variables
 are allocated before the stack, offseting the top of stack address.

, reproduced in Listing

 This example is interesting for several reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The bias effects are significant and easily reproducible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The example code is simple and easy to analyze
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No satisfactory explanaition as to what causes bias was given in the original
 paper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use perf and an automated script to collect performance counter statistics
 over a series of runs, with increasing environment size using a dummy variable
 between each execution.
 The program is compiled using GCC with all default options.
 Note that any optimization would likely disregard most of the function
 as redundant code, and reduce it to return zero immediately.

Collecting the cycle count performance counter, we observe a distinct spike
 over a period of 16 (verify!) bytes.
 The difference is over 20 % between the worst and best case.
 A good starting point in trying to analyze the potential cause for these
 effects, is to look at all the data provided by various performance counters.
 The set of counters that most closely follows the cycle count is shown
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 We have used a simple linear correlation to filter out what metrics might
 be of interest.

 refers to Memory Order Buffer, a collection of caches for read and write

 speculatively and out of order.
 It appears that a read/write dependency is falsely detected, causing the
 pipeline to wait for the previous memory operations to complete.

It is difficult to observe the correct addresses for variables g and inc
 without introducing observer effects.
 Simply adding a call to printf for instance, completely changes the program
 behaviour with repect to bias.
 Printing the addresses manually with assembly code however, does work.

 have the following addresses;

Run-time Solutions to Address Aliasing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, the address of stack variables cannot be determined statically.
 In addition to being offset by environment variables, the stack can also
 be perturbed by other factors, such as address layout randomization.
 Because of this, effects from 4K aliasing is observed as measurement bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to rewrite the program to avoid aliasing, regardless of initial
 stack position.
 The collisions between (

, 
\family typewriter
i
\family default
) and (
\family typewriter
inc
\family default

) can be checked before executing the loop, introducing an alternate code
 path with no address conflicts.

Only one pari of variables needs to be checked in this case, as both static
 and stack variables are allocated concecutively.
 Running the same tests again, we are able to remove all aliasing from this
 particular program.
 In most cases, assuming a uniform random distrubution of initial stack
 addresses, the program performs slighly worse because of the additional
 overhead and extra instructions executed.
 However, on average over all execution contexts, in this case stack positions,
 introducing this check yields a speedup.

For moderately large allocations, the input and output arrays will 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 be aligned to 12 bits.
 The likely cause of alias problems here is a conflict between input[i]
 and output[i].
 Although distinct memory locations, the out of order memory system detects
 conflicts.
 The hypothesis can be tested by offseting one of the arrays before calling
 convolve.
 We allocate some extra space for output, and use pointer arithmetic to
 offset the buffer sent to convolve.
 Offset is defined using a compile directive, adding no overhead in the
 generated source.
 The impact of a constant addition of allocated space is neglegtible.

Note that the number of alias conflicts reduces with increasing offset.
 This is likely because adjacent indeces are accessed in the loop.
 If output is offset by 0x01, then output[i] is aliased with input[i-1].
 Intuitively, one could suspect that an offset of 3 floats would be enough
 to eliminate alias, as the maximum difference is 2.
 (Is this true for low optimization?) We find that as many as 16 is needed
 on the highest level of optimization, illustrating the depth of speculative
 execution of memory operations.

 pointers to their respective memory areas, and not accesses through any
 other (aliased) pointers.
 This results in much more efficient code.
 We find that the following compile parameters for gcc provide the best
 code.

We see that the cycle count is drastically reduced, down to about 3.5 million.
 However, we still have over 1 million resource stalls, and 250 thousand
 alias events, which might indicate that even providing restrict is not
 enough.

Again, we test the hypothesis by incrementing an offset to the ouput pointer
 before calling convolve.
 At 0x30, we find the optimal configuration.
 We reduce the number of alias effects to a neglegtible amount, and numberof
 resource stalls is cut in half.
 Even with every opportunity for optimization given to the compiler, we
 are still able to squeeze out a speedup of 1.16x just by changing memory
 addresses.
 This speedup is consistent through input sizes, similar for 0x1000000.

Other Compilers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The alias effects on this particular example is most prominent on GNU's
 cc.
 We have tested on clang and icc as well -- with varying results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
clang behaves similar to cc with respect to offsets to minimize alias.
 However, we only need to add 0x10 to get rid of aliasing.
 The change in cycle count is not as clear (Need more controlled benchmark).
 A lot less efficient code is generated, almost ten times as many dynamic
 instructions executed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
icc produces code that performs reasonably well with respect to alias count
 on no additional offset.
 Interestingly, a very similar count of address alias events are recorded
 for code compiled with cc, about 260,000 for N = 0x100000.
 Alias can be eliminated almost completely, but that requires an offset
 of 0xa0.
 Performance actually worsenes with smaller offsets, increasing alias count
 significantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Libraries as Environment Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous example does not show measurement bias per se, but rather an
 artifact of the particular implementation of malloc.
 A perfectly legal implementation of malloc could insert offsets on every
 other large request.
 Bottom line is: dynamically linked libraries are part of the execution
 environment.

 Many allocators try to battle lock contention for multithreaded programs,
 where each thread share a common heap space.
 Allocating and freeing dynamic memory from a shared pool must be synchronized
 in some way.
 Testing multiple allocators might be worthwile, particularly for multithreaded
 applications.
 A potential cause of producing

 is optimizing around a bad allocator, or one that perform sub-optimally

Need some measurements to support this claim ...
 Pretty easy to test malloc replacements, just change LD_PRELOAD apparently.
 Question: Does any of the implementations of malloc optimize for parallell
 sequential array access, reducing alias effects? Probably not, which is
 cool! Could suggest fix.
 (Heuristic, or static analysis, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\begin_layout Description
tcmalloc Aligns at page boundary, ending in 0x000.
 Uses low addresses, 0xa49000 etc.
 Returns page-aligned areas for smaller allocations as well -- possible
 environment bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We did some testing with three of the libraries, allocating two arrays of
 equal length for different sizes.
 The libraries produce very different results.
 The default implementation alternates between using the brk segment (low
 addresses and non-aligned, and mmap on higher segments.
 Tcmalloc tends to put variables on page boundaries, also for small sizes,
 returning addresses ending in 0x000.
 Hoard tends to align on page boundaries for larger requests, with addresses
 ending in 0x070.

The Loop Stream Detector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typical software spends most of the time executing the same instructions
 repeatedly in a loop.
 For each iteration, the same branch predictions are made, and the same
 instructions are fetched and decoded.
 The Loop Stream Detector (LSD) is a front-end hardware optimization that
 is able to detect small software loops 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ramesh:i7PerformanceMonitoring"

\end_inset

.
 Instead of repeatedly fetching and decoding the same instructions, loops
 can be streamed directly from a queue of already decoded micro operations.
 Normal operations is resumed once the inevetable branch mispredict occurs.

This optimization is affecting both performance and power efficiency.

Properties of the Loop Stream Detector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A set of restrictions is given on what loops can be recognized by the loop
 stream detector.
 The Architectures Optimization Reference Manual 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Intel:2012:OptimizationManual"

\end_inset

 states the following requirements for a loop to be recognized by the LSD:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Up to eight chunk fetches of 32 instruction-bytes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Up to 28 micro-ops (~28 instructions)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All micro-ops are also resident in the Decoded ICache
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Can contain no more than eight taken branches and none of them can be a
 CALL or RET
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cannot have mismatched stack operations.
 For example, more PUSH than POP instructions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Loops should have at least 64 iterations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capabilities of the LSD is changing between processor generations.
 In particular, the limits to chunk fetches, maximum number of micro-ops
 and taken branches seems to continuously increase 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 It is not clear whether the stated limitations are valid for the Ivy Bridge,
 as it is not explicitly stated in the manual.
 We create a series of micro benchmarks to manually verify what the actual
 limitations are.

Chunk fetches 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The documentation states that a maximum number of eight 32 byte 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chunks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of instruction data can be fetched in each loop.
 Our interpretation of this is that instructions are read from instruction
 cache in blocks of 32 bytes at a time, and each chunk is aligned to multiples
 of 0x20 in virtual address space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test this limit, we need loops that execute instructions spanning a variable
 amount of chunks.
 The micro kernel we used is shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:lsd-chunks"

\end_inset

; multiple identical conditional statements are executed, but always evaluated
 to false to skip through to the next chunk.
 The example code is tuned such that each of the if statements occupy exactly
 32 instruction bytes when compiled with 
\family typewriter
gcc -O3
\family default
.
 Additionally, the compiler flag 
\family typewriter
-falign-loops
\family default
 is set to 32, explicitly forcing the first loop instruction to a multiple
 of 0x20.
 Notice in the example object dump below, the first instruction starts on
 address 
\family typewriter
0x400500
\family default
.
 The first 10 bytes of the generated assembly consist of three instructions;
 a 
\family typewriter
mov
\family default
, loading variable 
\family typewriter
i
\family default
 to a register, a 
\family typewriter
test
\family default
, and a conditional jump.
 The conditional will always evaluate to false, thus the remaining 22 bytes
 is dead code.

Bias from Chunk Fetch Limit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stated limit of 8*32B of instructions is way too much for consecutive
 live loop statements.
 To test this limit we have to space out the executed instructions with
 lots of branches.
 In the following program, the macro expands to 9*3B of mov instructions.
 The cmp and jump instructions generated by the branch makes up another
 5 bytes, making every statement a total of 32B.
 Every branch is not taken -- thus the instructions actually executed in
 each iteration is just the compare and branch.

 The address of the first instruction is 0x4004d3, and the last 0x400643.
 If instructions are buffered in chunks of 32B, then chunks must be a multiple

 The first instruction is pretty far into the 0x4004

Observe that by carefully aligning the first instruction, we can fit the
 code into only 12 instruction chunks.
 By inserting 13 nop instruction in the assembly code before the loop, addresses
 of the first and last instructions are offset to, respectively, 0x4004e0
 and 0x400650.
 0xe0 is at the very beginning of a chunk, and 0x50 leaves room for another
 16 bytes (6 of which are occupied by the very last jump instruction).
 Running the same program with these 13 nop instructions results in a dramatic
 improvement in performance.

The first directive tries to align to four bits, inserting at most 10 bytes
 for padding.
 If that does not work, the next directive forces loops to be aligned to
 three bytes -- meaning addresses ends in 0x0 or 0x8.
 Within a 32B instruction block, the first loop instruction can end up having
 one of the four suffixes 0x00, 0x08, 0x10 or 0x18.
 Using this knowledge, we can construct another example that overflows the
 12 blocks for certain alignment.

Long function names
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Function names are placed in the .strtab section in the ELF file.
 When running readelf or objdump, the names are used to print nice output.
 However, function names of external symbols resolved at run-time does affect
 code layout.
 Longer function names (or more external dependencies) will offset the text
 segment because of allocable segments related to dynamic linking is placed
 before text.
 This includes dynsym, dynstr, gnu.version and rela sections in an executable
 made with GCC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Using strip
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various sections of the ELF binary is not necessarily needed for normal
 execution.
 Quite a lot of extra information is included to aid in debugging etc.
 The strip command gets rid of symbol table and stringtable.
 These sections are non-allocable, so itdoes not affect code layout.
 Printing with objdump for example will not be as nice.
 Text segment is not marked with functions (internally resolved symbols).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to specify specific segments to remove using the -R parameter.
 Removing the .note sections for example, will probably not prevent the program
 from running correctly.
 Even though they are located (and allocated) before the .text segment, stripping
 them out will not offset code.
 This makes sense, as any reordering would require offseting every jump
 address accordingly.

In principle, anything that can change the memory layout of the code or

\begin_layout Standard
We used the latest version 3.3.3 of FFTW in all our tests, compiled from source
 and built as a shared library.
 For optimal performance on our machine, we explicitly enable support for
 sse2 and avx instruction set.
 In addition, we set the

Test Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FFTW is a very comprehensive library with lots of functionality.
 Our approach will be to engineer simple use cases where bias is easily
 measurable.
 We create a small C program with two parameters; the number of elements
 to transform, and the number of times to repeat the transform.
 This way, slight bias in smaller input sizes can be amplified.

 The static constants are loaded initially, using only a few load instructions.

\begin_layout Standard
Even though we are able to remove most of the alias effects, performance
 did not improve as much as we had hoped.
 The constant overhead added by inserting the extra instructions in apply_extra_

 About 1 million additional dynamic instructions are added to our example
 in the modified version, an increase of 1.3 %.

Creating the Worst Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the static alignment in place, it is not hard to imagine where the
 modified version will fail.
 If input and ouput buffers happen to reside on the opposite of the 4 KiB
 segment, we should see consistently bad performance for all environment
 sizes.
 By allocating another buffer of 7400B using regular malloc before calling
 fftw_malloc, the input and output buffers are pushed to 
\family typewriter
0x604da0
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
0x604f00

 respectively.

 and

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 close to the lower end of a 4KiB range of address suffixes.
 A hypothetical complete solution would require a function at least these
 three parameters to calculate the optimal stack offset.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(\text{ri},\text{ro},\text{\%rsp}\right)\rightarrow\text{offset}
\]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A plausible solution to the worst case scenario from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fftw-worstcase-4k"

\end_inset

 would be to align stack to start at 
\family typewriter
ri
\family default
, no longer overlapping any heap segments.
 However, given the somewhat discouraging results from our simple static
 fix, we did not attempt to implement a function like this for the 
\family typewriter
n1fv_16

 kernel.
 The added cost of additional dynamic instructions will quickly cancel out
 any speedup we might get.

Bias in Other Kernels

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have only looked at one particular kernel, although FFTW in fact
 consists of a quite large collection of automatically generated codelets.

\begin_layout Subsection
Ways to Account for Address Alias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main problem we faced when trying to do anything about aliasing within
 FFTW itself, was that too many dynamic instructions are added in the process.
 The problem is of course that the hack is implemented inside the hot loop,
 where fftw_execute is called repeatedly.
 However, we can also align stack 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the loop, adding only a neglegtible overhead.
 The relevant parts of our modified main function is shown in Listing

There is clearly a potential for speedup of FFTW kernels by accounting for
 aliasing in some way.
 However, requiring users of the library to fiddle with the stack before
 calling fftw_execute is not a satifactory solution.
 A more reasonable approach would be to encorporate these ideas in the steps
 performed 
\emph on

\emph default
 to executing a plan.

The planner can not know the stack depth of which a user calls fftw_execute
 with a given plan, thus simply benchmarking multiple alternative implementation

\begin_layout Standard
As might be suspected, the worst case configuration is observed when all
 arrays align closely on the last 12 bits.
 Between the best and worst configuration, there is a potential for 1.074x
 speedup.
 We conclude that the most probable cause of bias must be falsely predicted
 dependencies due to address aliasing.
 For the worst case, the number of alias events is about 18 % of cycle count,
 indicating many missed opportunities for out of order execution.
 Supporting this hypothesis, we find no apparent correlation between cycle
 count and cache efficiency.
 The L3 performance counters shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:blas-dgemv-perf"

\end_inset

 shows little variation, and does not explain the performance variations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bias effects can be amplified by calling dgemv multiple times in a loop,
 avoiding overhead from malloc.
 With repeated invocations on the same data, we are able to get more than
 1.30x speedup between the worst and best case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dealing With Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users of BLAS packages are probably more willing to invest in hand optimizing
 hot spots where bias might occur.
 It is not unlikely that one or more matrix-vector operations are part of
 a hot loop.
 Bias from address alias can heavily impact performance, and will probably
 be worth considering in some cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the particular case we investigated, a good heuristic is to alignin
 heap segments 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

far apart
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 within the 4 KiB area of 12 bit suffixes.
 More specifically, it appears that address suffixes of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{y}$
\end_inset

 are the most important to separate.
 A possible run time solution can be realized as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Allocate some extra space for one of the vectors when calling malloc, for
 instance 
\family typewriter
sizeof(double) * (M + 0x100)
\family default
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{y}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Check the returned pointers for potential alias, i.e.
 the difference between 
\family typewriter
&A
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
&y
\family default
.
 Offset using pointer arithmetic into the array with extra padding at the
 end, i.e.
 
\family typewriter
y += 0x100
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases it will be possible to accurately predict the address of larger
 matrices such as 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 For larger requests, malloc will call mmap and always align to page boundary.
 Perhaps this can simplify the calculations somewhat.
